How to run a tracking simulation...

All of this code exists in the 'ultratrack' svn respository.

* A template driver script exists in the repository (arfi_scans_template.m); copy
it to the directory with the FEM results that you're interested in tracking.

* Edit most of the first half of the template script to:
    (1) Link to appropriate paths if they need to be changed,
    (2) Setup the appropriate tracking configuration.

* The driver script can be launched from the command line as an input to
* matlab.  This is ammenable to execution via SGE, where the script inputs can
* be populated as different tasks.
